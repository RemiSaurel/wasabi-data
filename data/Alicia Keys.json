She was raised by a single mother in the Hell\'s Kitchen area of Manhattan in New York City. At age seven, Keys began to play classical music on the piano. She attended Professional Performing Arts School and graduated at 16 as valedictorian. She later attended Columbia University before dropping out to pursue her music career.\r\rIn 2000, Alicia Keys was the one out of the three first artists signed to Clive Davis\' now-defunct label, J Records (along with Mario Barrett and Olivia); later released her debut album with the label that following year, having had previous record deals first with Columbia and then, Arista Records.\r\rKeys\' debut album, Songs in A Minor, was a commercial success, selling over 12 million copies worldwide and peaking at #1 on the Billboard 200. She became the best-selling new artist and best-selling R&B artist of 2001. The album earned Keys five Grammy Awards in 2002, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for "Fallin\'". Her second studio album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, was released in 2003 and was also another success worldwide, selling eight million copies. The album garnered her the second album to peak at the top spot, pushing off Jay-Z\'s Black album, an additional four Grammy Awards in 2005. Later that year, she released her first live album, MTV Unplugged: Alicia Keys, which debuted at number one in the United States. She became the first female to have an MTV Unplugged album to debut at number one and the highest since Nirvana in 1994.\r\rKeys made guest appearances on several television series in the following years, beginning with Charmed. She made her film debut in Smokin\' Aces (with fellow co-star Common) and went on to appear in The Nanny Diaries in 2007. Her third studio album, As I Am, was released in the same year and sold six million copies worldwide, earning Keys an additional three Grammy Awards. The following year, she appeared in The Secret Life of Bees, which earned her a nomination at the NAACP Image Awards. She released her fourth album, The Element of Freedom, in December 2009, which became Keys\' first chart-topping album in the United Kingdom, however, it was a commercial disappointment, debuting at #2 on both the Billboard 200 and Top R&B Albums chart behind Susan Boyle\'s I Dreamed a Dream and Mary J. Blige\'s Stronger with Each Tear, respectively. Throughout her career, Keys has won numerous awards and has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. Billboard magazine named her the top R&B artist of the 2000–2009 decade, establishing herself as one of the best-selling artists of her time.\r\rDuring 2010, it was rumored that Keys was dating hip-hop musician Swizz Beatz, in which she later stated it was true. They wedded in March 2011 and had 3 children later on. On October 27, 2011, Alicia Keys received an e-mail from Sony Music Entertainment (J\'s parent label), informing that all four labels: J Records, Arista Records, Jive Records and LaFace Records, will all be shut down and merged altogether to re-form RCA Records. It means that all of the artists that were previously signed to the four defunct labels (including Keys herself, Chris Brown (4), R. Kelly, Kid Ink, D\'Angelo, Pitbull, Pink, Usher, ASAP Rocky, Christina Aguilera, etc.) were either/all to be re-arranged to RCA or to leave Sony Music.\r\rIn late 2012, Alicia Keys released her first project for RCA since the Jive/J/Arista/LaFace shut-down mergers, Girl on Fire, which became her fourth album to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 and helped garnered her successful album title single (later remixed featuring Nicki Minaj) and "New Day" (which, at first, featured 50 Cent and Dr. Dre, but was cut-off).\r\rOn June 25, 2014, Keys announced her Alicia Youth Foundation, which helps children with problems related to education and poverty.\r\rIn 2015, amid the most controversial event of the year and in music rivalry history, The 7 Rivalries in 7 Days, after Ja Rule vs. Chief Keef, Tamar Braxton vs. Dej Loaf, Young Thug (2) vs. J. Cole and Azealia Banks vs. Ciara, Alicia Keys (in Day 5 of the event) has ignited her first music feud in her career as an artist with female rapper Lil\' Kim.\r\rIn 2016, Keys generated more controversy after grudging body images on women, which caused a feud with singer Teairra Mari; later that year, Keys released her sixth album, Here, which became another commercial disappointment in the singer\'s career.\r', 'nameVariations': ['A Keys', 'A.

'"A Woman\'s Worth" is a song by American singer–songwriter Alicia Keys. A piano-driven soul ballad, it was written by herself and musician Erika Rose and produced by Keys for her debut album, Songs in A Minor (2001).The track was released as the album\'s second single in February 2002 following the worldwide success of her debut single the previous year, and became another top ten success for Keys in New Zealand and the United States, where it also reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The accompanying music video, directed by Chris Robinson, is a continuation of the "Fallin\'" video and explored what happens when Keys\' onscreen love interest gets released from prison and he tries to acclimate to society.The clip was nominated for both Best R&B Video and Best Cinematography at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, while the song won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Song in the same year.', 'releaseDate': [], 'runtime': ['303.0', '253.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['Alicia Keys songs', 'Songs written by Alicia Keys', 'Music videos directed by Chris Robinson (director)', '2002

The chorus contains re-sung elements from Yarbrough and Peoples\' 1980 song "Don\'t Stop the Music", which were also used on Common\'s 1997 song "All Night Long" featuring Erykah Badu.', 'releaseDate': ['2002-07-03'], 'runtime': ['239.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['2002 singles', '2002 songs', 'Alicia Keys songs', 'Eve (rapper) songs', 'Songs written by Lonnie Simmons', 'Interscope Records singles', 'Ruff Ryders Entertainment singles', 'Music videos directed by Director X'], 'isClassic': False, 'urlITunes': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/id19842453?i=19842464', 'urlSpotify': 'https://play.spotify.com/track/0kTmKrd9K5XfzcikZohAhf', 'urlAllmusic': 'http://www.allmusic.com/song/mt0007560120', 'title': "Eve:Gangsta Lovin'", 'deezer_mapping': [[959180, 'youtubefgpt'], [980979, 'youtubefgpt'], [980979, 'sptfviaenki']], 'id_song_deezer': '959180', 'isrc': 'USJAY0100054', 'length': '214', 'explicitLyrics': False, 'rank': 493255, 'bpm': '92', 'gain': '-10.3', 'preview': 'http://e-cdn-preview-9.deezer.com/stream/9f1519882a0bfae658b83a29e36dd0ef-1.mp3', 'availableCountries': ['AD', 'AG', 'AI', 'AL', 'AM', 'AO', 'AR', 'AT', 'AU', 'AW', 'AZ', 'BA', 'BB', 'BD', 'BE', 'BF', 'BG', 'BI', 'BJ', 'BM', 'BN', 'BO', 'BR', 'BS', 'BT', 'BW', 'BY', 'BZ', 'CA', 'CD', 'CF', 'CG', 'CH', 'CI', 'CL', 'CM', 'CN', 'CO', 'CR', 'CU', 'CV', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DJ', 'DK', 'DM', 'DO', 'DZ', 'EC', 'EE', 'ER', 'ES', 'ET', 'FI', 'FJ', 'FR', 'GA', 'GB', 'GD', 'GE', 'GF', 'GH', 'GI', 'GM', 'GN', 'GP', 'GQ', 'GR', 'GT', 'GW', 'GY', 'HK', 'HN', 'HR', 'HT', 'HU', 'ID', 'IE', 'IL', 'IN', 'IS', 'IT', 'JM', 'KE', 'KG', 'KH', 'KI', 'KM', 'KN', 'KR', 'KY', 'KZ', 'LA', 'LC', 'LI', 'LK', 'LR', 'LS', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MA', 'MC', 'MD', 'ME', 'MF', 'MG', 'MH', 'MK', 'ML', 'MN', 'MQ', 'MR', 'MS', 'MT', 'MU', 'MV', 'MW', 'MX', 'MY', 'MZ', 'NA', 'NC', 'NE', 'NG', 'NI', 'NL', 'NO', 'NP', 'NR', 'NZ', 'PA', 'PE', 'PF', 'PG', 'PH', 'PK', 'PL', 'PN', 'PR', 'PT', 'PW', 'PY', 'RO', 'RS', 'RU', 'RW', 'SB', 'SC', 'SE', 'SG', 'SI', 'SK', 'SL', 'SN', 'SO', 'SR', 'ST', 'SV', 'SZ', 'TC', 'TD', 'TG', 'TH', 'TJ', 'TM', 'TN', 'TO', 'TR', 'TT', 'TV', 'TW', 'TZ', 'UA', 'UG', 'US', 'UY', 'UZ', 'VC', 'VE', 'VG', 'VN', 'VU', 'WS', 'ZA', 'ZM', 'ZW'], 'publicationDate': '2001-06-25', 'urlMusicBrainz': '', 'urlPandora': '', 'urlYouTube': 'aNI8XFEAyI0', 'urlAmazon': '', 'urlHypeMachine': '', 'urlGoEar': '', 'urlLastFm': '', 'multitrack_path': '', 'multitrack_file': '', 'language': '', 'begin': '', 'disambiguation': '', 'end': '', 'id_song_musicbrainz': '', 'id_artist_deezer': '228', 'id_album_deezer': '107584', 'urlDeezer': 'http://www.deezer.com/track/959180', 'language_detect': 'english', 'title_accent_fold': "Eve:Gangsta Lovin'", 'animux_paths': [], 'explicit_content_lyrics': 0}, {'_id': '5714dec425ac0d8aee38e6f0', 'position': 2, 'urlSong': 'http://lyrics.wikia.com/Alicia_Keys:Fallin%27', 'lyrics': 'I keep on fallin&apos; in<br>In love with you<br>Sometimes I love you<br>Sometimes you make me blue<br><br>Sometimes I feel good<br>At times I feel used<br>Lovin&apos; you darlin&apos;<br>Makes me so confused<br><br>I keep on fallin&apos; in and out <br>Of love with you<br>I never loved someone<br>The way that I loved you<br><br>Oh, oh, I<br>Never felt this way<br>How do you give me so much pleasure<br>And cause me so much pain<br><br>Just when I think<br>I&apos;ve taken more than would a fool<br>I start fallin&apos;<br>Back in love with you<br><br>I keep on fallin&apos; in and out <br>Of love with you<br>I never loved someone<br>The way that I loved you<br><br>Oh baby<br>I, I, I, I&apos;m fallin&apos;<br>I, I, I, I&apos;m fallin&apos;<br>Fall, fall, fall<br>Fall, fall<br><br>I keep on fallin&apos; in and out <br>Of love with you<br>I never loved someone<br>The way that I loved you<br><br>I&apos;m fallin&apos; in and out<br>Of love with you<br>I never loved someone<br>The way that I loved you<br><br>I&apos;m fallin&apos; in and out<br>Of love with you<br>I never loved someone<br>The way that I loved you', 'urlWikipedia': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallin%27', 'id_album': '5714debb25ac0d8aee34edba', 'format': ['CD single', '12-inch single'], 'genre': ['Gospel music', 'Contemporary R&B', 'Soul music'], 'producer': ['Alicia Keys'], 'recordLabel': ['J Records'], 'writer': ['Alicia Keys'], 'recorded': ['2001'], 'abstract': '"Fallin\'" is a song by American recording artist Alicia Keys.

Inspired by the 2001 death of fellow R&B singer Aaliyah, the terrorist September 11 attacks in New York City, and other different events in the world and in Keys\' life at that time, it is about "how material things don\'t feed the soul." Musically, the slow bluesy piano ballad features musicians Hugh McCracken on guitar and Steve Jordan on drums.Released in February 2004 as the album\'s second single, the song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became Keys\' second consecutive R&B chart-topper, remaining atop the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for six weeks. The song received two nominations at the 2005 Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, winning in the latter.A remix featuring Usher, a Kanye West Radio Mix, and a Spanish-language version featuring Arturo Sandoval appear on the bonus CD of select international pressings of The Diary of Alicia Keys. The song is featured in the 2004 PlayStation 2 karaoke game Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.The single cover depicts Keys similarly to the subject of Man Ray\'s 1924 painting Le Violon d\'Ingres.',

produced by American singer Alicia Keys for her second studio album, The Diary of Alicia Keys (2004). Inspired by the 2001 death of fellow R&B singer Aaliyah, the terrorist September 11 attacks in New York City, and other different events in the world and in Keys\' life at that time, it is about "how material things don\'t feed the soul." Musically, the slow bluesy piano ballad features musicians Hugh McCracken on guitar and Steve Jordan on drums.Released in February 2004 as the album\'s second single, the song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became Keys\' second consecutive R&B chart-topper, remaining atop the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for six weeks. The song received two nominations at the 2005 Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, winning in the latter.A remix featuring Usher, a Kanye West Radio Mix, and a Spanish-language version featuring Arturo Sandoval appear on the bonus CD of select international pressings of The Diary of Alicia Keys. The song is featured in the 2004 PlayStation 2 karaoke game Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.The single cover depicts Keys similarly to the subject of Man Ray\'s 1924 painting Le Violon d\'Ingres.',

'recorded': ['Kampo Studios'], 'abstract': '"If I Ain\'t Got You" is a song recorded, written, and produced by American singer Alicia Keys for her second studio album, The Diary of Alicia Keys (2004). Inspired by the 2001 death of fellow R&B singer Aaliyah, the terrorist September 11 attacks in New York City, and other different events in the world and in Keys\' life at that time, it is about "how material things don\'t feed the soul." Musically, the slow bluesy piano ballad features musicians Hugh McCracken on guitar and Steve Jordan on drums.Released in February 2004 as the album\'s second single, the song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became Keys\' second consecutive R&B chart-topper, remaining atop the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for six weeks. The song received two nominations at the 2005 Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, winning in the latter.A remix featuring Usher, a Kanye West Radio Mix, and a Spanish-language version featuring Arturo Sandoval appear on the bonus CD of select international pressings of The Diary of Alicia Keys. The song is featured in the 2004 PlayStation 2 karaoke game Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.The single cover depicts Keys similarly to the subject of Man Ray\'s 1924 painting Le Violon d\'Ingres.',

It received praise from music critics, who complimented the new musical direction, as well as criticizing the downgrade of Keys\' "powerhouse voice" in favor of percussion.

Keys co-wrote and co-produced the hip hop/R&B ballad with Jeff Bhasker and Salaam Remi. The song\'s drum beat is sampled from the 1980 song "The Big Beat" by American rock guitarist Billy Squier, who received a writing credit on "Girl on Fire". Released on September 4, 2012, as the lead single from the album of the same name, "Girl on Fire" is Keys\' first release under RCA Records following the closure of J Records, after a reorganization at Sony Music Entertainment."Girl on Fire" was inspired by Keys\' giving birth to her son Egypt and marriage to husband Swizz Beatz. Keys recorded a three-track suite for the song, consisting of the main version in addition to two remixes. The first remix, titled "Inferno", adds two new verses from Trinidadian hip hop artist Nicki Minaj, whilst the second mix titled "Bluelight" strips back the drums and piano leaving a sparse bass-led production and re-recorded "smokey" vocals. "Girl on Fire" opened to extremely positive reviews from critics, with many praising Keys\' vocals and the song\'s production. Keys performed "Girl on Fire" for the first time at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on September 6, 2012, where she was joined by Minaj and American gymnastics gold-medalist Gabby Douglas.

fifth studio album Girl on Fire (2012). It was written and produced by Keys along with Gary Clark, Jr. and Andrew Wansel and Warren Felder from production duo Pop & Oak. "Fire We Make" is a downbeat neo soul ballad with adult contemporary R&B influences, in which Keys and Maxwell adopt sensual falsetto vocals. The instrumental elements used on it include echoing electric guitar riffs and clapping synthesizers. In "Fire We Make", Keys and Maxwell, as the protagonists, confess their love and speak of the chemistry they have with each other which they compare to fire that is "getting hotter and hotter.""Fire We Make" was well received by contemporary music critics, who noted its similarity to songs by Prince; they also praised its steamy production and the vocal performance of both singers. Released as the album\'s third single in the United States in March 2013, it has since reached number 29 on Billboard\u200d\u200a\'\u200bs Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 1 on Adult R&B chart. Its music video was directed by Chris Robinson and shot in the French Quarter neighborhood New Orleans, Louisiana in April 2013.

Studios', 'Jungle City Studios', 'Record Plant'], 'abstract': '"Girl on Fire" is a song recorded by American singer-song writer Alicia Keys for her fifth studio album of the same name. Keys co-wrote and co-produced the hip hop/R&B ballad with Jeff Bhasker and Salaam Remi. The song\'s drum beat is sampled from the 1980 song "The Big Beat" by American rock guitarist Billy Squier, who received a writing credit on "Girl on Fire". Released on September 4, 2012, as the lead single from the album of the same name, "Girl on Fire" is Keys\' first release under RCA Records following the closure of J Records, after a reorganization at Sony Music Entertainment."Girl on Fire" was inspired by Keys\' giving birth to her son Egypt and marriage to husband Swizz Beatz. Keys recorded a three-track suite for the song, consisting of the main version in addition to two remixes. The first remix, titled "Inferno", adds two new verses from Trinidadian hip hop artist Nicki Minaj, whilst the second mix titled "Bluelight" strips back the drums and piano leaving a sparse bass-led production and re-recorded "smokey" vocals. "Girl on Fire" opened to extremely positive reviews from critics, with many praising Keys\' vocals and the song\'s production. Keys performed "Girl on Fire" for the first time at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on September 6, 2012, where she was joined by Minaj and American gymnastics gold-medalist Gabby Douglas. The song has sold over 3 million paid downloads in the United States.', 'releaseDate': ['2012-09-04'], 'runtime': ['224.0'], 'award': ['Silver', 'Platinum', 'Gold'], 'subject': ['Songs written by Jeff

It was released as the third single from Jay-Z\'s 11th studio album, The Blueprint 3 (2009), by his Roc Nation label in October 2009. The song was written as a tribute to both artists\' hometown, New York City, and features a music sample of "Love on a Two-Way Street" (1970), written by Sylvia Robinson and Bert Keyes and performed by The Moments. "Empire State of Mind" was originally written by Brooklyn natives Angela Hunte and Jane\'t "Jnay" Sewell-Ulepic who were feeling homesick while on an overseas trip in February 2009. The following month they submitted the song to Jay-Z\'s Roc Nation, whose reviews were a discouragement. Following an incident that Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic describe as an omen, they took the suggestion of an associate of EMI Music Publishing and resubmitted it to Jay-Z, who kept the sung "New York" hook, changed the verses, and recorded it as a single.The single was supposed to feature Hunte on the song\'s hook, but when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought anyone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested Keys. Mary J. Blige was also considered for the part, but Keys was chosen after Jay-Z heard the song\'s piano loop. The song was viewed as being an "orchestral rap ballad" and has pop-rap musical styles. It contains references to various locations in New York and its famous residents, while describing the city\'s essence. Profanity is present throughout the song and, although it is usually included during live performances, it was omitted during the performance at Game 2 of the 2009 World Series.It was included in multiple critics\' top 10 list for the best songs of 2009; including Rolling Stone magazine and the New York Times. The song was also nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.  "Empire State of Mind" achieved commercial success worldwide. The track peaked within the top 10 in countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, Italy and Sweden.
