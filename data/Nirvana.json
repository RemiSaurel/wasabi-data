Looking at these photos &#x2013; which as far as we know don&#x2019;t have an official dating, we see Kurt playing a Univox guitar. But, since we don&#x2019;t have a clear date on the pictures were taken, let&#x2019;s try and figure it out.</p>\n\n<p>On further inspection of those photos we see a couple of concert flyers on the wall behind Kurt; there&#x2019;s one of the band Dr.Know who played at Downtown Tacoma (around 2 hours drive from Kurt&#x2019;s place) on September 27th 1986, and another one of Meat Puppets and Black Flag. We also know that the picture was taken at his house in Aberdeen, WA, but not in his actual room but in the hallway connecting the rooms on the top floor (see Tour of Kurt Cobain&#x2019;s Childhood Home). Kurt lived in that house from 1983 to 1984 when he was kicked out by his mom for dropping out of highschool. He then went on to live with his friends until September 1986 when his mom loaned him money to move into another house with Matt Lukin from the band Melvins.</p>\n\n<p>So it is almost sure that the photo of Kurt holding a Univox Hi-Flier was taken in late September 1986, in a room which was most likely set up as a temporary place for Kurt to sleep before he moved on.</p>\n\n<p>Now to the actual guitar,</p>\n\n<p>Kurt&#x2019;s Univox was a model called Hi-Flier, and it was most likely manufactured sometime between 1974 and 1977. Main guide in determining these dates are the two humbuckers on the guitar which didn&#x2019;t appear on this model until 1974, and it&#x2019;s white pickguard which was replaced with a black one on sunburst models in 1977. It was basically a cheap alternative to the Mosrite Ventures model, a guitar Kurt used later on in his career.</p>\n\n<p>Kurt played this guitar presumably from mid 80s to around 1988 on all of the early Nirvana gigs in 1987. He painted the pickguard pink, and had a ton of stickers on the body. He then ended up smashing it at Washington&#x2019;s Evergreen State College in October 1988.

This comes with a letter from Earnie detailing the complete modifications done to this guitar.

Japanese made. &quot;Fender sent this out for the In Utero tour to replace the blue one. Stock pickups were very shrill. After Kurt&apos;s coma in Rome, I thought modifying this guitar would make it a workhorse and get him away from the Mustang-Jaguar image. Hopefully get him perked up. I put on new tuners (Gotoh&apos;s - his favorite). A Tele bridge from Stew-Mac with a humbucker cut-out and individual saddles for each string. In the bridge, I put a Duncan JB - black, and in the neck, a new Gibson PAF, potted with a Chrome cover. He got this back 2 weeks before he died, and said it was his new favorite.

Kurt supposedly only had one EchoFlanger, despite what is said in (32). Kurt used the EchoFlanger on the Brazil shows (source info?

Both pedals were taken on the &quot;In Utero&quot; tour. </p>\n\n<p>The EchoFlanger sometimes &quot;acted up&quot; and Earnie gave Kurt his PolyChorus as a back-up.

Earnie sent out another PolyChorus to Kurt, hoping to get his back, but the &quot;new&quot; one broke and was given to Eric Erlanderson of &quot;Hole&quot; who had it fixed.

Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1985 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene, having its debut album Bleach released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989.After signing with major label DGC Records, the band found breakthrough success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from its second album Nevermind (1991). Following the success of Nevermind, Nirvana was labeled "the flagship band" of Generation X, and Cobain hailed as "the spokesman of a generation". Cobain, however, was often uncomfortable and frustrated, believing his message and artistic vision to have been misinterpreted by the public, with his personal issues often subject to media attention.During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction, illness and depression. He also had difficulty coping with his fame and public image, and the professional and lifelong personal pressures surrounding himself and his wife, musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle, the victim of what was officially ruled a suicide by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. The circumstances of his death at age 27 have become a topic of public fascination and debate. Since their debut, Nirvana, with Cobain as a songwriter, has sold over 25 million albums in the US, and over 75 million worldwide. Cobain was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, along with Nirvana bandmates Novoselic and Dave Grohl, in their first year of eligibility.'}, {'id_member_musicbrainz': '3da65013-dfdd-40c7-b9c7-e4c829862c66', 'name': 'Pat Smear', 'instruments': [], 'begin': '1993-08-09', 'end': '1994-04-05', 'ended': True, 'disambiguation': '', 'type': 'member of band', 'gender': 'Male', 'urlAllmusic': 'http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mn0000180216', 'urlDiscogs': 'https://www.discogs.com/artist/251655', 'urlOfficialWebsite': 'http://www.patsmear.com/', 'urlWikidata': 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q353973', 'urlWikipedia': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Smear', 'id_member_discogs': '251655', 'realName': 'Georg Ruthenberg', 'abstract': 'Born Georg Ruthenberg in Los Angeles, CA, on August 5, 1959, Smear ran away from home at the age of 13 to join a Jesus commune. Smear then attended an academic program for youths who were ostracized by public education. One of his classmates was vocalist Darby Crash, with whom he formed  Germs in the late \'70s. Also including Lorna Doom (bass) and Don Bolles (drums), the Germs became one of the most influential punk groups to emerge from L.A.\'s underground scene. However, Crash died from a heroin overdose in 1980, abruptly ending the Germs\' incendiary existence. Smear released his first solo album, Ruthensmear, on SST Records in 1987; he recorded the follow-up, So You Fell in Love With a Musician, in 1992. A year later, Smear was asked by the Red Hot Chili Peppers to replace guitarist John Frusciante; however, he turned them down. Instead, Smear toured as a member of Nirvana, establishing a close friendship with frontman Kurt Cobain and his wife Courtney Love. Smear briefly joined former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl\'s band Foo Fighters, playing on the group\'s 1997 album The Colour and the Shape. He quit in 1997 only to re-join in 2011 after years as a touring member. Smear may not be as familiar as his former bandmates, but he is a punk icon. Sonic Youth paid homage to him in the chorus of "Screaming Skull"; in addition, Grohl idolized him as a teen. Balancing his musical contributions with acting, Smear can be seen in the videos for Prince\'s "Raspberry Beret" and No Doubt\'s "Don\'t Speak." Moreover, he was often featured on MTV\'s House of Style.', 'nameVariations': ['P.

We wanted to move back to that huge, warm, sludgy sound and get something a little more garagey -- not something so well-produced and pristine. So rather than play through a distortion pedal and an amp with its volume at 5, we wouldn&apos;t use a pedal at all.&quot; After being asked if there is any trick to recording natural guitar sounds Dave Grohl explained, &quot;The best way to get a natural guitar sound is to eliminate all pedals and find an amp that has a lot of range. With an AC30, for example, you can go clean, dirty, bright, or fat.

When he wanted a dirty sound, he would go to the Mesa Boogie, and there was a Marshall that was in the mix every once in a while. I got rid of that and I bought a three-channel amp at the time, and now we use four-channel amps, so I can get a wide range of tones and sounds.

He was fired after playing only a couple of performances with the band, mostly because of his inability to attend rehearsal sessions regularly. Foster lived hours away from Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic back in Aberdeen, Washington, which required the men to pick Foster up and bring him to the band\'s rehearsal space in Tacoma. Based on Cobain\'s own account, this made band practices complicated.According to Charles R. Cross in his 2001 Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven, Cobain\'s final straw with Foster came after Foster was arrested for assaulting the son of the mayor of Cosmopolis, Washington, which landed him in jail for two weeks, and caused him to have his driver\'s license revoked, and being fined thousands of dollars in the victim\'s medical expenses.Neither Cobain nor Novoselic informed Foster directly of his termination. According to Cross, Foster realized he was out of the band when he saw an advertisement for an upcoming Butthole Surfers show featuring Nirvana as the opening act that he was unaware of.Ironically, a lengthy termination note addressed to Foster was included, unsent, in Kurt Cobain\'s published Journals, which while praising Foster\'s drumming, also bemoans the difference in cultural background between Foster and Cobain, who both were Aberdeen natives.After being fired from Nirvana, Foster played with the bands Suckerpunch, Psycho Samaritan and Helltrout. He can be heard as a guest drummer on the Mico de Noche album called Cherries (he plays on "Dirty Unicorn" and "Tu\'s Place").'}, {'id_member_musicbrainz': '797dc323-fc39-4597-98cc-d10493f67326', 'name': 'Jason Everman', 'instruments': [], 'begin': '1990-08', 'end': '1990-08', 'ended': True, 'disambiguation': '', 'type': 'member of band', 'gender': 'Male', 'urlAllmusic': 'http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mn0001217832', 'urlDiscogs': 'https://www.discogs.com/artist/441072', 'urlWikidata': 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q443395', 'urlWikipedia': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Everman', 'id_member_discogs': '441072', 'realName': '', 'abstract': '', 'nameVariations': ['Jason Evermann'], 'urls': [], 'urlEquipBoard': 'http://equipboard.com/pros/jason-everman', 'equipments': [{'type': 'Guitars', 'items': [{'name': 'Fender Telecaster', 'description': '<p>Jason Used it on Nirvana time (1989), you can see him at left on this photo, that was shot on Club Dreamerz, 07/08/89, Chicago</p>', 'urlDescription': 'http://equipboard.com/pros/jason-everman/fender-telecaster', 'url': 'http://equipboard.com/items/fender-telecaster', 'img': 'http://images.equipboard.com/uploads/item/image/4196/fender-telecaster-s.jpg?v=1502457893'}, {'name': 'Gibson Les Paul Studio Electric Guitar', 'description': '<p>Only source is this picture end Alex Roberts page.</p>', 'urlDescription': 'http://equipboard.com/pros/jason-everman/gibson-les-paul-studio-electric-guitar', 'url': 'http://equipboard.com/items/gibson-les-paul-studio-electric-guitar', 'img': 'http://images.equipboard.com/uploads/item/image/3375/gibson-les-paul-studio-electric-guitar-s.jpg?v=1502425332'}]}, {'type': 'Amplifiers', 'items': [{'name': 'Marshall JCM800 2203 Vintage 100W Tube Head Amp', 'description': '<p>in this photo you can see jason everman on the left of the stage using a marshall jcm800 head on a marshall 1960a 4x12,and a fender twin reverb 2x12. he used this amp set up for all of the 1 month he played shows with nirvana.</p>', 'urlDescription': 'http://equipboard.com/pros/jason-everman/marshall-jcm800-2203-vintage-100w-tube-head-amp', 'url': 'http://equipboard.com/items/marshall-jcm800-2203-vintage-100w-tube-head-amp', 'img': 'http://images.equipboard.com/uploads/item/image/4782/marshall-jcm800-2203-vintage-100w-tube-head-amp-s.jpg?v=1502426677'}, {'name': 'Fender Twin Reverb 1968 Silverface', 'description': '<p>in this photo you can see jason everman on the left of the stage using a marshall jcm800 head on a marshall 1960a 4x12,and a fender twin reverb 2x12. he used this amp set up for all of the 1 month he played shows with nirvana.</p>', 'urlDescription': 'http://equipboard.com/pros/jason-everman/fender-twin-reverb-1968-silverface', 'url': 'http://equipboard.com/items/fender-twin-reverb-1968-silverface', 'img': 'http://images.equipboard.com/uploads/item/image/9318/1965-fender-twin-reverb-s.jpg?v=1501958743'}]}, {'type': 'Effects Pedals', 'items': [{'name': 'Boss DS-1 Distortion Guitar Effects Pedal', 'description': '<p>At left in the foto is orange pedal like Boss.

Andy Marshall at THD Electronics upgraded the preamp line out and modded the amp for KT-90 tubes (see below for more info). We bought a Groove Tubes speaker emulator to run the entire amp through the power amps and into the array of Boogie &amp; Marshall cabs. The line out direct from the preamp sounded best, so we typically ran the HiWatt not utilizing the KT-90 output section at all, with the exception of the Crocodile Cafe show where I believe we used the HiWatts with 2 Marshall 4&#xD7;12 cabs, and the recording of In Utero.

Considered by many to be the leading lights of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 1980s/early 1990s, and perhaps the most influential rock band of Generations X & Y, Nirvana was a powerful trio of musicians who brought a unique aesthetic to a growing-stale rock scene.  They had already made some waves on Sub Pop with their debut, "[m=13773]".  But it wasn\'t until their major-label debut for DGC/Geffen Records, 1991\'s "[m=13814]" - perhaps, more specifically, the first 30 seconds of "[m=22439]" - that they broke into the mainstream of America - not really because they wanted to. Lead singer frontman Kurt Cobain\'s death (suspected suicide) in April 1994 brought an untimely end to the band. Drummer Dave Grohl went on to form the Foo Fighters.  In the fall of 2004, "[m=42482]" (a 3-CD/DVD set of mostly unreleased material) confirmed that interest in the band is still very high. Most young rock stars today will likely cite Nirvana as a major influence on them.

Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990. Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and important rock bands of the modern era.In the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from the band\'s second album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana\'s sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band\'s frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the "spokesman of a generation", with Nirvana being considered the "flagship band" of Generation X. In response, Nirvana\'s third studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group\'s audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind but was still a commercial success and critically acclaimed.Nirvana\'s brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain\'s widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, in its first year of eligibility.', 'name_accent_fold': 'Nirvana', 'nameVariations_fold': [], 'animux_path':

'abstract': '"Negative Creep" is a song by American rock band Nirvana from its 1989 debut album Bleach. The song was written by Kurt Cobain about himself, and how he claimed that he always saw himself as a negative person. It was named as one of the  "Sub Popiest" grunge songs the band ever recorded. IGN called it "a text book example of Seattle\'s true grunge sound". The song has also been described as "creepy" which works quite well with the title. "Negative Creep" is the only song on Bleach (including the reissued tracks), that does not end abruptly. Instead it fades out with the vocals, giving it a 60s pop aesthetic.The line "Daddy\'s little girl ain\'t a girl no more" shares similarities to the early Mudhoney single B-side "Sweet Young Thing Ain\'t Sweet No More", later re-released on Superfuzz Bigmuff Plus Early Singles. Nirvana does not credit the song and the line was under the speculation of plagiarism. Some reviewers instead see the songs as an ode, not a ripoff, such as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" being an ode to the Pixies\' "Debaser".The song was included on the soundtrack to the 1996 documentary,

It is the opening track and lead single from the band\'s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic. The sound of the song (as Cobain admits) is modeled after the sound of the Pixies.The unexpected success of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana\'s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992."Smells Like Teen Spirit" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an "anthem for apathetic kids" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain\'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest songs of all time.', 'releaseDate': ['1991-09-10'], 'runtime':

"In Bloom" became the fourth and final single from the album in late 1992. It was accompanied by a new music video which parodied musical performances of 1960s variety shows.

The song was released as the first single from the group\'s third and final studio album, In Utero, in 1993. It was one of two songs from the album mixed by Scott Litt in order to augment the original production by producer Steve Albini. While Nirvana\'s label DGC Records did not release a physical single for sale in the United States, "Heart-Shaped Box" received much American radio airplay, reaching number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. The song\'s music video, directed by Anton Corbijn, garnered critical plaudits, and won two awards, including Best Alternative Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1994.', 'releaseDate':

band The Vaselines for their EP Dying for It. It is a parody on the Christian children\'s hymn, "I\'ll Be a Sunbeam," which has the opening line "Jesus wants me for a sunbeam."The song was a hit only in indie-pop and twee circles until in 1992, The Vaselines re-released the song in 1992 on the compilation albums The Way of The Vaselines: A Complete History and All the Stuff and More. On All the Stuff and More, the title was changed slightly to "Jesus Doesn\'t Want Me for a Sunbeam".Nirvana released a cover titled "Jesus Doesn\'t Want Me for a Sunbeam" on their live acoustic album "MTV Unplugged in New York." Two more versions of this song were released on the 2004 box set With the Lights Out. This included an acoustic version recorded in Europe in 1994, along with a live electric performance on the DVD section of the box-set. Another version was released on 2011 as a bonus track on the 20th anniversary edition of Nevermind.On the version contained on the MTV Unplugged in New York album, Kurt Cobain refers to the song as: "a rendition of an old Christian song, I think. But we do it the Vaselines\' way." Elvis Costello uses the line "Maybe Jesus wants you for a sunbeam" in the song "Alibi" from his 2002 album When I Was Cruel.On the deluxe edition of their 2014 Album Bleach House, Phillip Boa And The Voodooclub released a cover of "Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam".', 'releaseDate': ['1994-11-01'], 'runtime': ['277.0', '211.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['The Vaselines songs', '1987 songs', 'Nirvana

It is the opening track and lead single from the band\'s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic. The sound of the song (as Cobain admits) is modeled after the sound of the Pixies.The unexpected success of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana\'s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992."Smells Like Teen Spirit" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an "anthem for apathetic kids" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain\'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest songs of all time.', 'releaseDate': ['1991-09-10'], 'runtime':

The song was written by Kurt Cobain about himself, and how he claimed that he always saw himself as a negative person. It was named as one of the  "Sub Popiest" grunge songs the band ever recorded. IGN called it "a text book example of Seattle\'s true grunge sound". The song has also been described as "creepy" which works quite well with the title. "Negative Creep" is the only song on Bleach (including the reissued tracks), that does not end abruptly. Instead it fades out with the vocals, giving it a 60s pop aesthetic.The line "Daddy\'s little girl ain\'t a girl no more" shares similarities to the early Mudhoney single B-side "Sweet Young Thing Ain\'t Sweet No More", later re-released on Superfuzz Bigmuff Plus Early Singles. Nirvana does not credit the song and the line was under the speculation of plagiarism. Some reviewers instead see the songs as an ode, not a ripoff, such as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" being an ode to the Pixies\' "Debaser".The song was included on the soundtrack to the 1996 documentary,

It is the opening track and lead single from the band\'s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic. The sound of the song (as Cobain admits) is modeled after the sound of the Pixies.The unexpected success of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana\'s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992."Smells Like Teen Spirit" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an "anthem for apathetic kids" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain\'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest songs of all time.', 'releaseDate': ['1991-09-10'], 'runtime':

American rock band Nirvana. Written by frontman Kurt Cobain, the song addresses people outside of the underground music community who did not understand the band\'s message.Nirvana made its first music video for an early version of "In Bloom" in 1990; however the song did not appear on a commercial release until the release of the group\'s second album, Nevermind, in 1991. "In Bloom" became the fourth and final single from the album in late 1992. It was accompanied by a new music video which parodied musical performances of 1960s variety shows. The music video for "In Bloom" won Best Alternative Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1993.', 'releaseDate': ['1992-11-30'], 'runtime': ['254.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['Grunge songs', '1991

The international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart.

Its subject is a preacher who hunts and captures a grey goose for dinner on a Sunday. He tries to kill the goose prior to eating it, but no matter how hard he tries, he cannot kill it, the implication being that he had not properly observed the Sabbath (however, there are other folk songs which may or may not have existed before this song that feature a Grey Goose, but not a preacher, that have a similar theme of the grey goose being indestructible). The various methods the preacher used to unsuccessfully kill the grey goose were, in order according to the song: Shooting it Boiling it Feeding it to a hog Cutting it with a mill-sawIt was recorded by Lead Belly in the 1930s. An instrumental version of this song was covered by members of the American band Nirvana and the Screaming Trees in Seattle in August 1989. The song was not released until 2004 on the box set titled With the Lights Out. In 2006, the children\'s music band Dan Zanes and Friends recorded a version of this song for the album Catch That Train.  In 2010, the song was recorded with the simple accompaniment using harmonica and drums by Country Blues artist and Blues in Schools educator, Big Jon Short for his album Big Shorty.  The song was also recorded by the band British Sea Power for one of the B-sides of their single "Please Stand Up". A poignant version of the song also was recorded by Sweet Honey in the Rock on the Grammy award winning album A Vision Shared produced by CBS as a tribute to Lead Belly (and Woody Guthrie) for

It is the opening track and lead single from the band\'s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic. The sound of the song (as Cobain admits) is modeled after the sound of the Pixies.The unexpected success of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana\'s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992."Smells Like Teen Spirit" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an "anthem for apathetic kids" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain\'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest songs of all time.', 'releaseDate': ['1991-09-10'], 'runtime':

February 15, 1993, and includes the songs "Puss" by the Jesus Lizard and "Oh, the Guilt" by Nirvana. The cover art for the single is a painting by Malcolm Bucknall called "Old Indian and White Poodle". "Puss"/"Oh, the Guilt" peaked at number 12 on the UK singles chart; it was The Jesus Lizard\'s first hit single in the UK, and Nirvana\'s sixth."Puss" first appeared on the 1992 album, Liar. The single was recorded by Steve Albini, who would later record Nirvana\'s third and final album, In Utero. The video for "Puss" showed a man being welded in a chair, so it was banned from some television stations."Oh, the Guilt" was recorded by Barrett Jones on April 7, 1992 in Seattle, Washington. The song was re-released in 2004 on the Nirvana rarities box set, With the Lights Out, and in 2005 on the compilation album, Sliver: The Best of the Box, although on these latter releases the song was remixed by Adam Kasper, and does not include the sound of lighter clicks present on the original mix.', 'releaseDate': ['1993-02-15'], 'runtime': ['182.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['Song recordings

It is the opening track and lead single from the band\'s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic. The sound of the song (as Cobain admits) is modeled after the sound of the Pixies.The unexpected success of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana\'s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992."Smells Like Teen Spirit" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an "anthem for apathetic kids" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain\'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest songs of all time.', 'releaseDate': ['1991-09-10'], 'runtime':

'"Marigold" (originally titled "Color Pictures of a Marigold") is a song written and composed by American rock  musician Dave Grohl, that was first released on Pocketwatch, an album Grohl issued under the pseudonym Late! in 1992.  The song is perhaps best known for the version that was recorded and released in 1993 by Nirvana, as a b-side to the "Heart-Shaped Box" single.  A live version was later featured on the Foo Fighters\' release Skin and Bones in 2006, garnering "Marigold" the notable distinction of being the only song released by both Nirvana and Foo Fighters, Grohl\'s two most distinguished bands.', 'releaseDate': [], 'runtime': ['153.0', '193.0', '200.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['Foo Fighters songs', '1992 songs', 'Alternative rock songs', 'Nirvana

band The Vaselines for their EP Dying for It. It is a parody on the Christian children\'s hymn, "I\'ll Be a Sunbeam," which has the opening line "Jesus wants me for a sunbeam."The song was a hit only in indie-pop and twee circles until in 1992, The Vaselines re-released the song in 1992 on the compilation albums The Way of The Vaselines: A Complete History and All the Stuff and More. On All the Stuff and More, the title was changed slightly to "Jesus Doesn\'t Want Me for a Sunbeam".Nirvana released a cover titled "Jesus Doesn\'t Want Me for a Sunbeam" on their live acoustic album "MTV Unplugged in New York." Two more versions of this song were released on the 2004 box set With the Lights Out. This included an acoustic version recorded in Europe in 1994, along with a live electric performance on the DVD section of the box-set. Another version was released on 2011 as a bonus track on the 20th anniversary edition of Nevermind.On the version contained on the MTV Unplugged in New York album, Kurt Cobain refers to the song as: "a rendition of an old Christian song, I think. But we do it the Vaselines\' way." Elvis Costello uses the line "Maybe Jesus wants you for a sunbeam" in the song "Alibi" from his 2002 album When I Was Cruel.On the deluxe edition of their 2014 Album Bleach House, Phillip Boa And The Voodooclub released a cover of "Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam".', 'releaseDate': ['1994-11-01'], 'runtime': ['277.0', '211.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['The Vaselines songs', '1987 songs', 'Nirvana

"In Bloom" became the fourth and final single from the album in late 1992. It was accompanied by a new music video which parodied musical performances of 1960s variety shows.

It is the opening track and lead single from the band\'s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic. The sound of the song (as Cobain admits) is modeled after the sound of the Pixies.The unexpected success of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana\'s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992."Smells Like Teen Spirit" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an "anthem for apathetic kids" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain\'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest songs of all time.', 'releaseDate': ['1991-09-10'], 'runtime':

is a song originally recorded by Scottish alternative band The Vaselines for their EP Dying for It. It is a parody on the Christian children\'s hymn, "I\'ll Be a Sunbeam," which has the opening line "Jesus wants me for a sunbeam."The song was a hit only in indie-pop and twee circles until in 1992, The Vaselines re-released the song in 1992 on the compilation albums The Way of The Vaselines: A Complete History and All the Stuff and More. On All the Stuff and More, the title was changed slightly to "Jesus Doesn\'t Want Me for a Sunbeam".Nirvana released a cover titled "Jesus Doesn\'t Want Me for a Sunbeam" on their live acoustic album "MTV Unplugged in New York." Two more versions of this song were released on the 2004 box set With the Lights Out. This included an acoustic version recorded in Europe in 1994, along with a live electric performance on the DVD section of the box-set. Another version was released on 2011 as a bonus track on the 20th anniversary edition of Nevermind.On the version contained on the MTV Unplugged in New York album, Kurt Cobain refers to the song as: "a rendition of an old Christian song, I think. But we do it the Vaselines\' way." Elvis Costello uses the line "Maybe Jesus wants you for a sunbeam" in the song "Alibi" from his 2002 album When I Was Cruel.On the deluxe edition of their 2014 Album Bleach House, Phillip Boa And The Voodooclub released a cover of "Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam".', 'releaseDate': ['1994-11-01'], 'runtime': ['277.0', '211.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['The Vaselines songs', '1987 songs', 'Nirvana
