It&apos;s a Hamony H78. And he&apos;s been playing this for several years. Boy, maybe five years or something. This is what he still uses in the middle of the set when they do a few songs as just a two-piece again. Even though they have a bass player and keyboard player that are playing with them now, they walk off for four songs or more. And he plays this guitar because it has a very distinctive sound because it&apos;s totally hollow and has these kickin&apos; pickups in it. I&apos;ve seen a lot of guitars that have this model of them in it but this one in particular sounds amazing. I don&apos;t know what model they actually are but they are usually referred to as Gold Foils  because they came in so many different guitars. But this guitar has three switches, one for each and volume and tone for each. We&apos;ve never really used anything but the bridge pickup. He&apos;s always collected guitars so he&apos;s had quite a lot of them over the years, but this one he&apos;s had in his operation for some time. He bought it from one of my helpers at the guitar shop in Akron. I had a guy helping me working on this thing and it needed a little bit of work. He wasn&apos;t working on it at the time because we had other things to work on. Then Dan came in one day and saw it and said &apos;Woo, how much for that one?&apos; So he didn&apos;t buy it that day, but we got it ready for the next time he came by - and he sure did.

It&apos;s a StratoTone. It&apos;s obviously had a lot of work done to it too. It has different tuning keys; I made new knot for it. Dan&apos;s dad deals antiques, and one of his cohorts or accomplices in the antique business gave Dan  this guitar. But it didn&apos;t have any parts at all. It didn&apos;t have any tuners, no pick guard, no pickups, no Bigsby or anything. I think it had that [white] switch. Anyway, he said &apos;I want to make this work,&apos; and so I got a set of Lindy Fralin pickups. This old Bigsby I think I had in my shop already. I made that pickguard. I was able to figure out, well it was pretty obvious, when you take the pickguard off its bright red underneath there because this awesome two-tone burst used to be a three-tone burst, like many from around maybe 1962 or whenever this is from - that era. The red  on many sunbursts just dissipates, it just comes out, it just disappears like a three-tone stratocaster  a lot of times becomes over time. So I just copied the image and made a pickguard to fit it. I put these Fralins in, the Bigsby on. Nothing really fancy. He plays this one in open-G tuning. For right now he&apos;s only playing it on one song, &apos;Run Right Back,&apos; which is on the new record. Although he recorded a few of the other songs in that tuning, he&apos;s transposed them to standard just for ease. But this one particular song has that powerful open-D on the bass string and it has to be in that tuning to make it and be effective. It&apos;s heavy duty, and it&apos;s got a pretty heavy-duty sound as well because those are P-90s, they just crunch as they should,&quot; says Dan Auerbach&apos;s guitar tech about the Harmony StratoTone Electric Guitar.</p>', 'urlDescription': 'http://equipboard.com/pros/dan-auerbach/harmony-stratotone-electric-guitar', 'url': 'http://equipboard.com/items/harmony-stratotone-electric-guitar', 'img': 'http://images.equipboard.com/uploads/item/image/4875/harmony-stratotone-electric-guitar-s.jpg?v=1502426762'}, {'name': 'Guild S-200 Thunderbird Electric Guitar', 'description': '<p>&quot;This is the one that is his current favorite. It&apos;s a &apos;64 Guild Thunderbird. It has a Bo-Diddley look to it. You don&apos;t see too many people through the history of rock-n-roll guitars playing this model for some reason. And I don&apos;t know why because it&apos;s awesome. It&apos;s got an amazing headstock shape. It&apos;s just not symmetrical. And I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s on any other Guild model either. I did have to do some work to it, but it&apos;s largely original. Of course, I did a setup, I did some fret work, I carved the saddles a few notches and other stuff to fine tune it. This bridge pickup didn&apos;t work so we had to have some coils made for it. Dan bought this shortly before we did Saturday Night Live last December. In fact, very shortly. He came in and said &apos;I need this guitar to work,&apos; and it was a bit of a project. You would see this bridge and tremolo arrangement on a Hagstrom from the mid to late 60s too. I&apos;m not sure who made them, maybe Burns or something like that.  It&apos;s a great tremolo; it stays in tune great. Dan uses the tremolo a lot but he  uses it gently, or fast but still gentle. He never tries to get crazy with it. The most amazing weird feature is that it has a stand built right into the back. It has a magnet too to keep it from coming up, but it doesn&apos;t work that great.

I spent a lot of time fixing that one up. Same pickups, same funky bridge pickups. It does have this really cool trim on it though. The stainless steel arm is pretty unique. There&apos;s a really interesting spring system under there too. Of course, you can select any of the pickups that you like too here. There&apos;s lots of knobs again. Same fiberglass construction. It gives it that sort of hollow guitar sound. Like the Harmony guitar, it&apos;s totally hollow and that&apos;s a big part of the sound Dan gets when he&apos;s playing especially the two-piece stuff. When it&apos;s just him and Patrick on stage feedback is a big part of the show because he&apos;s playing really loud and he&apos;s got the Big Muff on, and it&apos;s exploding,&quot; says Dan Auerbach&apos;s guitar tech about the National Westwood 77 Electric Guitar.</p>', 'urlDescription': 'http://equipboard.com/pros/dan-auerbach/national-westwood-77-electric-guitar', 'url': 'http://equipboard.com/items/national-westwood-77-electric-guitar', 'img': 'http://images.equipboard.com/uploads/item/image/5285/national-westwood-77-electric-guitar-s.jpg?v=1494836478'}, {'name': 'Supro Martinique Electric Guitar', 'description': '<p>&quot;We have this Supro. I have to admit there are so many models of these that I don&apos;t remember this one off hand. But I am very familiar with them, I&apos;ve had several of them myself.  The Supro and the National are pretty much the same guitar really. The shape is different. It&apos;s a fiberglass body bolted together. It has a very interesting bridge pickup too. There&apos;s a piezo pickup and some coils inside the bass of that bridge. It&apos;s an interesting sound. It kind of sounds like an acoustic guitar but not really. I mean not compared to modern standards. This has the typical National hot single coils - they really crunch. It has lots of knobs; everyone likes that.  The thing about it is I&apos;ve had to do quite a lot of work to it. I&apos;ve had to refret it and adjust the bridge and secure too so it would stay in tune. This has a truss rod in it, but it&apos;s the old box style, like an old Martin would have. It&apos;s not adjustable. Unfortunately, on a rock-n-roll guitar to have good action that&apos;s playable and clear you have to be able to really fine tune that. The only way to do that is not in the field, it&apos;s in the shop because you have to rig it up with the right amount of bow and then you have to test - take the strings off a lot of times until you get it right.

We took the analog appraoch because you have to step on the pedal itself to actuate it.  There&apos;s no remote. It does have an expression pedal jack, but you&apos;d have to have another expression pedal to make it work. And if you step on the pedal it just dips the signal an octave and it comes back up when you release it. It&apos;s so much easier to do it that way. That&apos;s the way it was designed in the first place. So for that riff I have a buffered signal that comes all the way out here to this pedal and all the way back to the rig. It just comes on when he plays that riff and then we move on to a cleaner signal path. I&apos;m just trying to keep all the time available his straight-into-amplifier sound because anything that you put in the path of that is not through bypass or splitters.

The group consists of Dan Auerbach (guitar, vocals) and Patrick Carney (drums). The duo began as an independent act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular garage rock artists during a second wave of the genre\'s revival in the 2010s. The band\'s raw blues rock sound draws heavily from Auerbach\'s blues influences, including Junior Kimbrough, Howlin\' Wolf, and Robert Johnson.Friends since childhood, Auerbach and Carney founded the group after dropping out of college. After signing with indie label Alive, they released their debut album, The Big Come Up (2002), which earned them a new deal with Fat Possum Records. Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and substantial licensing of their songs. Their third album, Rubber Factory (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band\'s profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label Nonesuch Records in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo completed Attack & Release (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer Danger Mouse, a frequent collaborator with the band.The group\'s commercial breakthrough came in 2010 with Brothers, which along with its popular single "Tighten Up", won three Grammy Awards. Their 2011 follow-up El Camino received strong reviews and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, leading to the first arena concert tour of the band\'s career, the El Camino Tour. The album and its hit single "Lonely Boy" won three Grammy Awards. In 2014, they released their eighth album, Turn Blue, their first number-one record in the US, Canada, and Australia.', 'name_accent_fold': 'The Black Keys', 'nameVariations_fold': ['Black Keys'],

and recorded by Richard Berry.

which on the original version is G-Am-Bb-Am, which is a 1-2m-m3-2m progression, whereas all the cover versions play a basic 1-4-5-4 progression, which in G would be simply G-C-D-C.', 'releaseDate':

The song also appears in the 2011 video game Driver: San Francisco.In the last verse, a girl named Sadie is mentioned. It\'s suggested that this is a reference to Dan Auerbach\'s young daughter, Sadie Little Auerbach, who was born in 2008.

It is the third track on their 2010 album Brothers and was released as the record\'s first single on April 23, 2010. Dan Auerbach told The Sun how the song originated: "That was the last song we did for the record. We had a couple of days off and so did Brian (Danger Mouse) and since we are friends and like hanging out with each other we thought it would be fun to go into the studio and see if we could come up with a tune. We always have a blast when the three of us get together.""Tighten Up" has been licensed to appear in the video game FIFA 11, the music video games Rocksmith and Rock Band 3 (as downloadable content for both), the television program Gossip Girl, a Subaru commercial, a Molson commercial, and the films I Am Number Four, Bad Teacher, and Spring Breakers. The song has become one of the most successful Black Keys singles in the United States, being their first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and reaching number one on the Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts. Rolling Stone put the song on its list of the 15 Best Whistling Songs of All Time. At the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011, the song won Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, while also receiving a nomination for Best Rock Song. Musically, the song is in the key of F sharp minor.', 'releaseDate': [], 'runtime': ['214.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['Singles certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America',

The song was a success on rock radio, reaching number two on the Alternative Songs chart in the US and the Alternative Rock and Active Rock charts in Canada. The group filmed a music video with director Danny Clinch at the Springwater Supper Club and Lounge, a dive bar in Nashville, Tennessee.
