After being taught how to play guitar by her uncle, she began playing at nightclubs under various names such as "Sparkle Jump Rope Queen" and "Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena" with no real ambition to pursue music as a career. In the fall of 2004, she enrolled at Fordham University in New York where she studied metaphysics. In her time being there was when her musical experience began. Between 2005 and 2009, she had several music projects including her works as May Jailer and Lizzy Grant.

Her debut studio album Lana Del Ray was released through the label in January 2010, to little attention. She later entered a joint recording contract with Interscope, Polydor, and Stranger Records in July 2011. Her major-label debut Born to Die was released in the following January; aided by initial Internet buzz surrounding her "Video Games" single, it peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was the fifth best-selling album of 2012. A remix of its single "Summertime Sadness", produced by Cedric Gervais, peaked at number six on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and stands as her highest-charting single in the United States. Paradise was simultaneously released as a standalone extended play and with the expanded version of Born to Die subtitled The Paradise Edition that November. Three of its tracks were featured in her short film Tropico, which premiered in December 2013. Del Rey\'s third studio album, Ultraviolence, was released in 2014, becoming her first number-one record in the United States. In 2015, she released her fourth studio album, Honeymoon.Del Rey\'s music has been noted for its cinematic style and its references to pop culture, particularly that of 1950s and 1960s Americana. The singer has described herself as a "gangsta Nancy Sinatra". She has claimed to draw influence from artists she deems to be "masters of their genre," as well as from poetry and film noir.

is a song recorded by American recording artist Lana Del Rey for her second studio album, Born to Die (2012). The song was produced by Robopop. The lyrics and musical composition are attributed to Del Rey and Justin Parker, author of her songs, "Blue Jeans" and "Born to Die" from the same album. It was first released to the Internet on June 29, 2011, was later released on her extended play, Lana Del Rey, and re-released as the lead single from her second studio album, Born to Die on October 10, 2011, through Interscope Records. Musically, "Video Games" is a baroque pop ballad, that lyrically refers to a girl who finds solace in the simple moments in life, such as watching her boyfriend play video games. The song garnered acclaim from music critics, many of whom praised the uniqueness of Del Rey\'s vocal performance and the song\'s cinematic production."Video Games" was a commercial success, peaking at No. 1 in Germany and Luxembourg, reaching a top 10 position in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom among others. The song\'s accompanying music video was directed and edited by the singer herself, combining scenes of Del Rey performing the song filmed on a webcam with clips of archive footage. Certified platinum in four countries, the song won an Ivor Novello Award for "Best Contemporary Song" in 2012 and was nominated for several other awards shortly after release. "Video Games" peaked at number 91 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, leading to a gold certification in 2013 when the RIAA changed how it calculated certifications. Following the release of her third EP, Paradise, the song returned to their Top Heatseekers chart at number 11.', 'releaseDate': ['2011-10-07'], 'runtime': ['282.0'], 'award': ['Platinum', 'Gold'],

Critics noted that it features apocalyptic lyrics and strings similar to John Barry compositions.

At the 2012 UK Music Video Awards, "Born to Die" won the "Best Pop - International Video" award, outranking her other songs "Blue Jeans" and "National Anthem" which were also nominees.

It was released on April 8, 2012, by Interscope Records as the third single from the record. Produced by Emile Haynie, the song was written by Del Rey, Haynie, and Dan Heath. It is a downtempo  ballad with hip hop influences. A controversial performance of the song on SNL placed Del Rey under scrutiny and polarized opinion. Charting across Europe and Asia, "Blue Jeans" reached the top 10 in Belgium, Poland, and Israel. Two music videos were created for the song. The first was self-produced. The second was shot and directed by Yoann Lemoine, featuring film noir elements and crocodiles.', 'releaseDate': ['2012-04-08'], 'runtime': ['210.0'], 'award': ['Gold'], 'subject': ['2010s ballads',

It was released on April 8, 2012, by Interscope Records as the third single from the record. Produced by Emile Haynie, the song was written by Del Rey, Haynie, and Dan Heath. It is a downtempo  ballad with hip hop influences. A controversial performance of the song on SNL placed Del Rey under scrutiny and polarized opinion. Charting across Europe and Asia, "Blue Jeans" reached the top 10 in Belgium, Poland, and Israel. Two music videos were created for the song. The first was self-produced. The second was shot and directed by Yoann Lemoine, featuring film noir elements and crocodiles.', 'releaseDate': ['2012-04-08'], 'runtime': ['210.0'], 'award': ['Gold'], 'subject': ['2010s ballads',

The song was produced by Robopop. The lyrics and musical composition are attributed to Del Rey and Justin Parker, author of her songs, "Blue Jeans" and "Born to Die" from the same album. It was first released to the Internet on June 29, 2011, was later released on her extended play, Lana Del Rey, and re-released as the lead single from her second studio album, Born to Die on October 10, 2011, through Interscope Records. Musically, "Video Games" is a baroque pop ballad, that lyrically refers to a girl who finds solace in the simple moments in life, such as watching her boyfriend play video games. The song garnered acclaim from music critics, many of whom praised the uniqueness of Del Rey\'s vocal performance and the song\'s cinematic production."Video Games" was a commercial success, peaking at No. 1 in Germany and Luxembourg, reaching a top 10 position in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom among others. The song\'s accompanying music video was directed and edited by the singer herself, combining scenes of Del Rey performing the song filmed on a webcam with clips of archive footage. Certified platinum in four countries, the song won an Ivor Novello Award for "Best Contemporary Song" in 2012 and was nominated for several other awards shortly after release. "Video Games" peaked at number 91 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, leading to a gold certification in 2013 when the RIAA changed how it calculated certifications. Following the release of her third EP, Paradise, the song returned to their Top Heatseekers chart at number 11.', 'releaseDate': ['2011-10-07'], 'runtime': ['282.0'], 'award': ['Platinum', 'Gold'],

studio album, Born to Die (2012). It was written by Lana Del Rey and Rick Nowels, while production was handled by Emile Haynie.  Nowels and Devrim Karaoglu produced the radio mix of the song. The song was released on March 1, 2013, by Universal and Vertigo Records, as the sixth and final single from Born to Die.The song received mainly mixed reviews from critics, many criticizing her melodramatic performance, also with the repetition of production and lyrical content. However, many believed the attraction of the criticism proved it as a highlight. Noticeably less successfully than other singles from the album, "Dark Paradise" managed to gain some commercial success in Eastern Europe, becoming a top five hit on Polish airplay.

'abstract': 'Born to Die is the second studio album and major-label debut by American recording artist Lana Del Rey. It was released on January 27, 2012 by Interscope Records, Polydor Records, and Stranger Records. Del Rey collaborated with producers including Patrik Berger, Jeff Bhasker, Chris Braide, Emile Haynie, Justin Parker, Rick Nowels, Robopop, and Al Shux to achieve her desired sound. Their efforts resulted in a primarily baroque pop record, which sees additional influences from alternative hip hop and trip hop music.Contemporary music critics were divided in their opinions of Born to Die; some commended its distinctive production, while its repetitiveness and melodramatic tendencies were a recurring complaint. The record debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 77,000 copies; it was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) after moving one million units. Born to Die reached the peak position on eleven international record charts, and has sold more than four million copies worldwide as of July 2014. Combined with the Paradise edition, total sales of the repackaged album exceed seven million copies worldwide. As of May 2015 Born to Die has sold 8.5 million copies worldwide.After attaining online success after its initial premiere on June 29, 2011, "Video Games" was released as the lead single from Born to Die on October 17, 2011; it peaked at number 91 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Its follow-up singles "Born to Die", "Off to the Races", "Blue Jeans", "Summertime Sadness", "National Anthem", and "Dark Paradise" performed sporadically across Billboard component charts and international record charts. "Summertime Sadness" was re-released on July 11, 2013 after being remixed by Cedric Gervais, and became Del Rey\'s highest-charting single in the United States after reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100. Del Rey additionally promoted Born to Die with several televised performances, including a widely-criticized appearance on Saturday Night Live. It was reissued on November 9, 2012 as an expanded version subtitled The Paradise Edition, which was packaged with her third extended play Paradise (2012).', 'releaseDate': ['2012-01-27'], 'runtime':

from her second studio album, Born to Die. The trip hop ballad was released on June 22, 2012 by Interscope Records as the fourth single of the album. Charting across Europe, the single reached the top ten in Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. In the spring of 2013, "Summertime Sadness" became a number-one hit in Poland and Ukraine. Trap and house remixes of "Summertime Sadness" helped Del Rey break into the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. That chart is where Del Rey\'s song became a modest hit and marked her first foray into the chart. On the accompanied Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, the single gave Del Rey her first US number-one single in August 2013. Earlier in 2012, the song also managed to become a rock hit in the US.In the summer of 2013, a remixed version of the track by Cedric Gervais was released to American contemporary hit radio and helped the single become a sleeper hit, debuting it at 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming the highest charting single of her career in that country with a peak of 6. Switzerland and Austria gave "Summertime Sadness" a gold certification; it reached platinum status in Germany and became a top forty year-end hit. The record also reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. It joined BBC Radio 1\'s and BBC Radio 2\'s playlists. Gervais\' remixed version won a 2014 Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical.A music video for the song features a lesbian couple, one played by Jaime King and the other played by Del Rey. As the storyline progresses, both characters commit suicide by jumping from perilous heights. Cinematography was handled primarily by King\'s husband, Kyle Newman. The video gained success on video-hosting website, YouTube, and circulated through social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter. In general, critics lauded the artistry of the single\'s music video, comparing it to Instagram. The musical arrangement was composed by Del Rey\'s long-time collaborators Emile Haynie and Rick Nowels, with Nowels and Del Rey writing the lyrics.', 'releaseDate': ['2013-07-11', '2012-06-22'],

heels in her hands, swaying in the wind<br>Oh she starts to cry, mascara running down her little Bambi eyes<br>&quot;Lana, how I hate those guys.&quot;<br><br>This is what makes us girls<br>We all

don&apos;t stick together &apos;cause we put love first<br>Don&apos;t cry about him, don&apos;t cry about him<br>It&apos;s all gonna happen<br><br>And that&apos;s where the beginning of the end begun<br>Everybody knew that we had too much fun<br>We were skipping school and drinking on the job<br>(With the boss)<br><br>Sweet 16 and we had arrived<br>Baby&apos;s table-dancing at the local dive<br>Cheering our names in the pink spotlight<br>Drinking cherry schnapps in the velvet night<br><br>Yo, we used to go break in<br>Into hotel, glimmer and we&apos;d swim<br>Running from the cops in our black bikini tops<br>Screaming, &quot;Get us while we&apos;re hot, get us while we&apos;re hot!&quot;<br>(Come on, take a shot)<br><br>This is what makes us girls<br>We all look for heaven and we

our eyes gleamed mean<br>A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens<br>And you know something?<br><br>They were the only friends I ever had<br>We got into trouble and when stuff got bad<br>I got sent away I was waving on the train platform<br>Crying &apos;cause I know I&apos;m never coming back<br><br>This is what makes us girls<br>We all look for heaven and we put our love

'"Ride" is a song by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey from her third EP, Paradise (2012). The song was written by Lana Del Rey and Justin Parker, while produced by Rick Rubin, the song served as the reissue\'s first single on September 25, 2012 through Interscope Records. "Ride" is a ballad that thematically involves parental problems, alcohol consumption, and loneliness. The cover for the song depicts Del Rey on a tire swing, wearing cowboy boots and a denim jacket."Ride" received positive reviews from music critics, who compared Del Rey\'s vocals with that of Adele and Brandon Flowers of The Killers. While only a modest hit in the United States, Switzerland, Ireland, and France, the song reached the top 10 in Russia and Belgium. The accompanying music video for "Ride" was directed by Anthony Mandler, and was released on October 12, 2012. Del Rey\'s role in the video was compared to Lolita and A Streetcar Named Desire. The monologue treatment at the prologue and epilogue of the video met polarized opinion; some considered it "meaningless" and a "jibe to her critics", while others called it "moving" and "really something".', 'releaseDate': ['2012-09-25'], 'runtime': ['289.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['2010s ballads', 'Pop ballads', '2012 singles', 'Lana Del Rey songs', 'Music videos directed by Anthony

Written by Del Rey and Rick Nowels, it is a melancholy love song that depicts a woman torn between love and ambition, while also serving as a dedication to the West Coast of the United States. A psychedelic rock, soft rock and surf rock ballad, "West Coast" was noted to be an evolution and more guitar-orientated in sound for Del Rey and was produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. Described as a two-in-one song, its shifting tempo transitions downward by nearly 60 beats per minute at the chorus, in a rhythmical shift reminiscent of The Beatles\' "And I Love Her" (1964) and "We Can Work It Out" (1965). In the song, Del Rey\'s vocal comprises a more sensual and sinister tone than in her previous discography, and are often sung in an anxious "breathy" style.Following its release as the lead single from the album on April 14, 2014, "West Coast" received universal acclaim from music critics who commended its unconventional composition and Del Rey\'s uncharacteristic vocal delivery. Several news media sources went on to list it as one of the best songs of 2014, including Consequence of Sound, NME and Spin. "West Coast" debuted at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Del Rey\'s highest debut and second highest-charting single of her career, while also becoming her first single to enter the Rock Airplay chart where it reached number 26. The song marked Del Rey\'s eighth top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart where it peaked at number 21.An accompanying black-and-white music video, directed by Vincent Haycock, was released on May 7, 2014. Shot at Marina del Rey, California and Venice, Los Angeles, it uses a minimalist and melancholy approach to depict Del Rey torn between two love interests, one of which is portrayed by Hollywood tattoo artist Mark Mahoney. The clip was well received by critics and was nominated for a 2014 MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography. Del Rey promoted "West Coast" with live performances at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Austin City Limits Music Festival and Glastonbury Festival 2014. The song has also been covered by James Vincent McMorrow and Royal Blood.', 'releaseDate': ['2014-04-14'], 'runtime': ['256.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['Songs written by Lana Del Rey', 'Soft rock

Auerbach'], 'recordLabel': ['Interscope Records', 'Polydor Records'], 'writer': ['Rick Nowels'], 'recorded': ['Easy Eye Sound', 'The Bridge'], 'abstract': '"West Coast" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey for her third studio album, Ultraviolence (2014). Written by Del Rey and Rick Nowels, it is a melancholy love song that depicts a woman torn between love and ambition, while also serving as a dedication to the West Coast of the United States. A psychedelic rock, soft rock and surf rock ballad, "West Coast" was noted to be an evolution and more guitar-orientated in sound for Del Rey and was produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. Described as a two-in-one song, its shifting tempo transitions downward by nearly 60 beats per minute at the chorus, in a rhythmical shift reminiscent of The Beatles\' "And I Love Her" (1964) and "We Can Work It Out" (1965). In the song, Del Rey\'s vocal comprises a more sensual and sinister tone than in her previous discography, and are often sung in an anxious "breathy" style.Following its release as the lead single from the album on April 14, 2014, "West Coast" received universal acclaim from music critics who commended its unconventional composition and Del Rey\'s uncharacteristic vocal delivery. Several news media sources went on to list it as one of the best songs of 2014, including Consequence of Sound, NME and Spin. "West Coast" debuted at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Del Rey\'s highest debut and second highest-charting single of her career, while also becoming her first single to enter the Rock Airplay chart where it reached number 26. The song marked Del Rey\'s eighth top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart where it peaked at number 21.An accompanying black-and-white music video, directed by Vincent Haycock, was released on May 7, 2014. Shot at Marina del Rey, California and Venice, Los Angeles, it uses a minimalist and melancholy approach to depict Del Rey torn between two love interests, one of which is portrayed by Hollywood tattoo artist Mark Mahoney. The clip was well received by critics and was nominated for a 2014 MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography. Del Rey promoted "West Coast" with live performances at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Austin City Limits Music Festival and Glastonbury Festival 2014. The song has also been covered by James Vincent McMorrow and Royal Blood.', 'releaseDate': ['2014-04-14'], 'runtime': ['256.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['Songs written by Lana Del Rey', 'Soft rock songs', 'Psychedelic rock songs', 'Lana Del Rey songs', '2014 singles', '2014 songs', 'Surf rock songs', 'Songs written by Rick Nowels', 'Song recordings produced by Dan Auerbach', 'Interscope Records singles'], 'isClassic': False, 'title': 'West Coast (Radio Mix)', 'deezer_mapping': [[78304893, 'search-exact']], 'id_song_deezer': '78304893', 'isrc': 'DEUM71401884', 'length': '228', 'explicitLyrics': False, 'rank': 368211, 'bpm': '103.9', 'gain': '-9.3', 'preview': 'http://e-cdn-preview-b.deezer.com/stream/bba17ffb502eca338fb814d675afe926-0.mp3', 'availableCountries': ['FR'], 'publicationDate': '2014-01-01', 'urlMusicBrainz': '', 'urlPandora': '', 'urlITunes': '', 'urlSpotify': '', 'urlYouTube': '', 'urlAmazon': '', 'urlHypeMachine': '', 'urlAllmusic': '', 'urlGoEar': '', 'urlLastFm': '', 'multitrack_path': '', 'multitrack_file': '', 'language': '', 'begin': '', 'disambiguation': '', 'end': '', 'id_song_musicbrainz': '', 'id_artist_deezer': '1424821', 'id_album_deezer': '8596882', 'urlDeezer': 'http://www.deezer.com/track/85269690', 'language_detect': 'english', 'title_accent_fold': 'West Coast', 'animux_paths': [], 'explicit_content_lyrics': 2}, {'_id': '5714ded825ac0d8aee4828b3', 'position': 12, 'urlSong': 'http://lyrics.wikia.com/Lana_Del_Rey:Black_Beauty', 'lyrics': 'I paint my nails black<br>I dye my hair a darker shade of brown<br>&apos;Cause you like your women Spanish dark, strong and proud<br>I paint the sky black<br>You said if you could have your way<br>You&apos;d make a nighttime all the day<br>So it&apos;d suit the mood of your soul<br>Oh, what can I do?<br>Nothing, my sparrow blue<br><br>Oh, what can I do?<br>Life is beautiful but you don&apos;t have a clue<br>Sun and ocean blue<br>Their magnificence, it don&apos;t make sense to you<br><br>Black beauty<br>Black beauty<br><br>I paint the house black<br>My wedding dress black leather, too<br>You have no room for light, love is lost on you<br>I keep my lips red<br>To seem like cherries in the spring<br>Darling you can&apos;t let everything seem so dark blue<br>Oh, what can I do?<br>To turn you on or get through you?<br><br>Oh, what can I do?<br>Life is beautiful but you don&apos;t have a clue<br>Sun and ocean blue<br>Their magnificence, it don&apos;t make sense to you<br><br>Black beauty<br>Black beauty<br>Black beauty<br>Black beauty<br>Black beauty<br>Black beauty, baby<br>Black beauty, baby<br><br>Oh, what can I do?<br>Life is beautiful but you don&apos;t have a clue<br>Sun and ocean blue<br>Their magnificence, it don&apos;t make sense to you<br><br>Black beauty<br>Black beauty<br>Black beauty<br>Black beauty', 'urlWikipedia': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Beauty_(Lana_Del_Rey_song)', 'id_album': '5714debe25ac0d8aee36733a', 'format': ['Music download'], 'genre': [], 'producer': ['Paul Epworth'], 'recordLabel': ['Vertigo Records'], 'writer': ['Rick Nowels'], 'recorded': [], 'abstract': '"Black Beauty" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey for her third studio album, Ultraviolence (2014).

the Beach" is a song recorded by American singer Lana Del Rey and the first single from her fourth studio album,  Honeymoon (2015). Written by Lana Del Rey, Rick Nowels and Kieron Menzies. A synth-led trap-pop and hip hop ballad, it is more uptempo and pop-indebted than Del Rey\'s previous releases, but prominently recalls the hip hop and trip hop influences of her 2012 album, Born to Die. The song is based around electronic production, a trap beat and an orchestral organ arrangement.Preceded by a premature online leak, "High By the Beach" was released as the lead single from Honeymoon on August 10, 2015. The song received universal acclaim from music critics, many of which named it as one of Del Rey\'s best and catchiest releases.

It was released on September 18, 2015, by UMG Recordings. Del Rey began planning the project two months after releasing her third studio album Ultraviolence (2014), ultimately deciding against reissuing the previous record in favor of producing a completely new follow-up project. Recording for the album began in December 2014, taking place at The Green Building and Electric Lady Studios before being finished in 2015.Del Rey co-produced Honeymoon alongside longtime collaborators Rick Nowels and Kieron Menzies creating a baroque pop and dream pop album, Honeymoon takes influence from numerous genres including jazz, trap, blues, electronic and hip hop and has been characterized as more reminiscent of her major-label debut Born to Die and follow-up extended play Paradise (2012) than its immediate predecessor, Ultraviolence. The music features subtly layered vocals, decaying synths, echoing guitar lines, restrained drum patterns, chopped-and-screwed samples, and hints of jazz with lyrics that focus on themes of tortured romance, bitterness, lust, drugs, escapism and violence.Upon release Honeymoon was commended by music critics, who praised its perceived consistency and timelessness, and further applauded Del Rey\'s vocal delivery. Commercially the album was a success debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200, and peaking at number one in Australia and Ireland. "High by the Beach" was released as its lead single on August 10, 2015, and was followed by promotional singles "Terrence Loves You", "Honeymoon", and "Music to Watch Boys To" in anticipation of the

third major-label record by American singer Lana Del Rey. It was released on September 18, 2015, by UMG Recordings. Del Rey began planning the project two months after releasing her third studio album Ultraviolence (2014), ultimately deciding against reissuing the previous record in favor of producing a completely new follow-up project. Recording for the album began in December 2014, taking place at The Green Building and Electric Lady Studios before being finished in 2015.Del Rey co-produced Honeymoon alongside longtime collaborators Rick Nowels and Kieron Menzies creating a baroque pop and dream pop album, Honeymoon takes influence from numerous genres including jazz, trap, blues, electronic and hip hop and has been characterized as more reminiscent of her major-label debut Born to Die and follow-up extended play Paradise (2012) than its immediate predecessor, Ultraviolence. The music features subtly layered vocals, decaying synths, echoing guitar lines, restrained drum patterns, chopped-and-screwed samples, and hints of jazz with lyrics that focus on themes of tortured romance, bitterness, lust, drugs, escapism and violence.Upon release Honeymoon was commended by music critics, who praised its perceived consistency and timelessness, and further applauded Del Rey\'s vocal delivery. Commercially the album was a success debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200, and peaking at number one in Australia and Ireland. "High by the Beach" was released as its lead single on August 10, 2015, and was followed by promotional singles "Terrence Loves You", "Honeymoon", and "Music to Watch Boys To" in anticipation of the parent record.', 'releaseDate': ['2015-09-18'], 'runtime': ['3906.0'], 'award': [], 'subject': ['2015 albums', 'Interscope Records albums', 'Lana Del Rey albums', 'English-language albums', 'Albums

is a song by American recording artist Lana Del Rey used for the soundtrack to the drama film The Great Gatsby (2013). It was released on April 23, 2013 by Interscope Records as the lead single from the record. "Young & Beautiful" was co-written by Del Rey and the track\'s producer, Rick Nowels (with an uncredited assist from director Baz Luhrmann). Contemporary music critics lauded the single, calling it "haunting" and "somber". Lyrically, "Young & Beautiful" follows a young lover\'s apprehension about whether love can last. A music video, directed by Chris Sweeney and filmed by Sophie Muller, was released on May 10, 2013. The song was used in commercials to promote the new season of the MTV reality show Catfish.A moderate chart success, "Young & Beautiful" reached the top ten in Australia where it was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was also top 10 hit on Serbian airplay chart, peaking at number 9. In May 2013, the song broke into the Billboard Hot 100; it peaked at 22 on the chart, making it Del Rey\'s highest peak since "Video Games" peaked at 91 in 2012. Shortly after, the song also peaked at 3 on the Hot Rock Songs chart. Del Rey and Nowels received accolades for their songwriting from various music and film awards, including nominations for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, and Best Song at the 19th Critics\' Choice Awards. They eventually won the Best Original Song at the 18th Satellite Awards. On January 26, 2014, "Young and Beautiful" was announced as number 7 on the annual Triple J\'s Hottest 100 in Australia.', 'releaseDate': ['2013-04-22', '2013-10-29'], 'runtime': ['227.0', '236.0'],
